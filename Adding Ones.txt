Ques.  You start with an array A of size N. Also, A[i] = 0 for i = 1 to N. You will be given K positive integers. Let j be one of these integers, you have to add 1 to all A[i], for i >= j. Your task is to print the array A after all these K updates are done.
 

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer  T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case consists of two space separated positive integers N and K. The second line consists of K space separated integers.
 

Output:
For each test case, in a new line print the array A from the first index to the last index after the K updates are done. Consecutive values are to be separated by a single space between them while printing.
 

Constraints:
1<= T <=100
1<= N, K <=1000

Example:
Input:
2
3 4
1 1 2 3
2 3
1 1 1
Output:
2 3 4
3 3
